Docker Resource Layer
=====================

This layer provides an interface for dealing with charm resources that are
Docker images.


Usage
=====

Using this layer generally consists of the following steps:

  * Call `layer.docker_resource.fetch(resource_name)`
  * Wait for `layer.docker-resource.{resource_name}.available`
  * Call `layer.docker_resource.get_info(resource_name)`

Alternatively, a resource can be marked with `auto-fetch: true` in its
definition in `metadata.yaml`, in which case it will automatically have
`fetch()` called on it, if it is of type `docker`.  That way, you can
skip the first step and remove the need for an additional handler.


Example
=======

Given a Kubernetes charm with the following resource definition in the
`metadata.yaml` file:

```yaml
name: my-charm
resources:
  my-resource:
    type: docker
    description: "The Docker image for this charm"
```

The charm would then use the follow reactive code to use the Docker image
resource:

```python
from charms.reactive import when, when_not

from charms import layer


@when_not('layer.docker-resource.my-resource.fetched')
def fetch_resource():
    layer.docker-resource.fetch('my-resource')


@when('layer.docker-resource.my-resource.available')
@when_not('charm.my-charm.started')
def start_container():
    layer.status.maintenance('configuring container')
    image_info = layer.docker-resource.get_info('my-resource')
    layer.caas_base.pod_spec_set({
        'containers': [
            {
                'name': 'my-service',
                'imageDetails': {
                    'imagePath': image_info.registry_path,
                    'username': image_info.username,
                    'password': image_info.password,
                },
                'ports': [
                    {
                        'name': 'service',
                        'containerPort': 80,
                    },
                ],
            },
        ],
    })
    layer.status.maintenance('creating container')
```

Reference
=========

Methods
-------

The methods available are:

  * `charms.layer.docker-resource.fetch(resource_name)`
    Request that the given Docker image resource be fetched and validated.

  * `charms.layer.docker-resource.get_info(resource_name)`
    Return the image info object for the given resource.

Image Info Object
-----------------

The image info object returned by `get_info(resource_name)` is a `DockerImageInfo`
instance which has the following properties:

  * `image_info.registry_path`
    This is the fully qualified registry path for the image.  This will
    generally point to the controller or charm store, but may point directly
    to an external registry.

  * `image_info.username`
    The username needed to access the image on the registry, if any.

  * `image_info.password`
    The password needed to access the image on the registry, if any.

Reactive Flags
--------------

The flags set by this layer are:

  * `layer.docker-resource.{resource_name}.fetched`
    Set as soon as the given resource has been requested by the `fetch` method.

  * `layer.docker-resource.{resource_name}.available`
    Set when the given resource has been downloaded and is available.

  * `layer.docker-resource.{resource_name}.failed`
    Set when the given resource failed to download.

Status Messages
---------------

This layer will automatically set a maintenance status message while fetching
each resource, and a blocked status message if one or more resources fail to
be fetched.  The statuses will be set using `layer:status` to handle conflict
resolution.

You can disable automatic status messages from this layer by changing the layer
option `set-status` to `false` in your `layer.yaml`.
